# üéß Recommendation Engine Exploration using Spotify Tracks

Welcome to the **Recommendation Engine** project, an intelligent system designed to suggest tracks to users based on a combination of track features, user preferences, and explainable insights. This project was built with the goal of exploring various machine-learning techniques behind recommendation systems and tackling engineering challenges like data processing, scalability, and API limitations.

## üåü Features

- **Cosine Similarity Recommendations**: Recommends songs based on cosine similarity using audio features like danceability, energy, valence, and more.
- **Explainable Recommendations**: Provides users with insights into why certain tracks are recommended by showing feature differences and similarity scores.
- **Weighted Recommendations**: Allows users to customize the importance of different track attributes to get more personalized recommendations.
- **Data Caching and Scalability**: Uses Redis for caching responses and employs background workers for periodic updates, effectively managing API rate-limits.
- **Multiple Recommendation Algorithms**: Explores traditional methods like **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**, **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**, and deep learning methods like **Autoencoders**. Investigated large-scale nearest neighbors using **FAISS** and **ANNOY**.
- **Data Preprocessing & Integration**: Processed large datasets with **Pandas**, integrated **BeautifulSoup** for scraping, and used **Requests** for API interactions.

## üìö Overview & Purpose

This project was driven by a curiosity to understand the mechanics behind recommendation engines, including both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. It serves as an exploration of balancing **recommendation accuracy** and **explainability** with **engineering considerations** like processing time, file sizes, and data shapes. The goal is to provide meaningful recommendations with insights that users can trust.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Spotify Developer Account**: Create an app on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) to get your `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Set up a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and get your connection string.
- **Render Account**: For deploying the service in a production-like environment.

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recommendation-engine.git
   cd recommendation-engine
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your credentials:

   ```
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
   MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
   SECRET_TOKEN=your_secret_token
   ```

5. Run the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

6. Access the API documentation at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```

### Running Unit Tests

- **Note**: `conftest.py` is used to manage the directory structure with `main.py` outside the `app` directory.
- Run tests:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- Run tests with coverage:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=app
  ```
- View missing lines in coverage:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
  ```

## üß† How It Works

### 1. Recommendation Logic

- Uses **cosine similarity** to measure the closeness of a target song's features with those in the database, recommending the top tracks.
- Allows for **weighted adjustments**, letting users prioritize attributes like energy or danceability in recommendations.
- Explores advanced algorithms like **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**, **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**, **FAISS**, **ANNOY**, and **Autoencoders** for deeper insights into large-scale recommendations.
- **Explainable AI**: Each recommendation includes the similarity score and differences in attributes (e.g., danceability, energy) to help users understand why a particular song was chosen.

### 2. Data Fetching & Storage

- **Spotify API Integration**: Fetches track metadata and audio features (e.g., tempo, key, loudness) using the Spotify API.
- **MongoDB**: Stores track data, ensuring quick access to recommendations and reducing dependency on real-time API calls.
- **Redis**: Caches responses to reduce API calls and improve response times.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates data fetching for missing information, processing 1,000 tracks simultaneously to stay within rate limits.

### 3. Background Jobs & Scalability

- Uses **Render Background Worker** for:
  - Fetching missing album images and audio features.
  - Periodically updating track information to ensure data freshness.
- An **uptime monitor** keeps the service active on the free tier of Render, preventing it from hibernating due to inactivity.

## üîß Technologies & Tools

- **Python & FastAPI**: For creating a fast, reliable backend.
- **Spotipy**: A lightweight Python library for accessing Spotify's Web API.
- **MongoDB**: Stores track data and user preferences.
- **Redis**: Improves performance with caching.
- **Pandas & BeautifulSoup**: For data preprocessing and web scraping.
- **SciKit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Pytest**: For unit testing and ensuring code reliability.
- **Render**: A modern cloud platform for deploying the service.

## üìà Future Improvements

- **NLP Integration**: Add sentiment analysis of lyrics to enhance the recommendations further, using libraries like **NLTK** or **spaCy**.
- **User Feedback Loop**: Allow users to rate recommendations and use this feedback to refine the recommendation algorithm.
- **Feature Expansion**: Include more user input options, such as allowing users to specify preferences like "I like the catchiness of this song" to shape recommendations further.
